<h2>Announcements of the exercises and their names in the file: </h2>

- **Exercise 1 / exer1:**  Write a program that reads the name and two grades of a student. The average should be calculated, and at the end, the calculated average and whether the student passed or failed should be reported (consider a minimum average of 7.0 for passing). The program should implement a method called "readGrade" responsible for reading a real value and another method called "calculateAverage" that should return the calculated average to the main method.

- **Exercise 2 / exer2:** Write a program that reads two real values and displays the difference between the larger and the smaller value. A method called "calculateDifference" should be implemented to perform the calculation and display the result.

- **Exercise 3 / exe3:** Given the input data of a person's height and gender, create a program that calculates the ideal weight using the following formulas: (h = height)

    - For men: (72.7 * h) - 58
    - For women: (62.1 * h) - 44.7
  
    - A method called "calculateIdealWeight" should be implemented to perform the calculation, which should receive the gender and height of the person as parameters. The presentation of the result will be done by the main method.

- **Exercise 4 / exe4:** Write a program that displays the following menu.

    - 1- Addition

    - 2- Subtraction

    - 3- Division

    - 4- Multiplication

    - 5- Remainder of Division

    - 6- Double

    - 7- Square

    - 8- Cube

    - 9- Square Root

    - 0- Exit

    - Create a method to perform the calculations and display the result for each item in this menu.

- **Exercise 5 / exe5:** Write a program that calculates and returns the value of the hypotenuse through the "calculateHypotenuse" method. The method should receive the values of the base and height of a triangle. Formula: hypotenuse² = base² + height²
